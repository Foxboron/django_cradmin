======================
Build Edit Delete List
======================

The goal in this part of the guide is to create a html page where we can easily add new songs or change an existing.
We will do this by creating as little code as possible, hence not creating any templates and our views will extends
some of the CRadmin Listbuilder classes mentioned in chapter :ref:`listbuilder_all_classes`. However we need to get a
form and write what the role query set should return.
