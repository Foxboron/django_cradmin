Expand Account model with message
=================================

This document contiunes the work done in :ref:`gettingstarted`.

Easy show messages in template
==============================
In this chapter we are going to create a new crapps named `publicui` which will have a listview for messages written by
an account with a little code as possbile.

Model
-----
 First we create a new model named `Message`. ::

    class Message(models.Model):
    """
    The message is created by logged in user in adminui and can be seen by anyone in the publicui.

    Number of likes on a post can be both negative or positive.
    """

    #: The account which created and posted the message
    account = models.ForeignKey(Account)

    #: The heading of a message
    title = models.CharField(max_length=15)

    #: The main text of a message
    body = models.TextField()

    #: The time a user posted the message is auto set to the time when the message was added
    creation_time = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

    #: How many people has liked the message. Can be a negative integer
    number_of_likes = models.IntegerField(default=0)

    def __str__(self):
        return self.title

CRadmin Instance
----------------
In the folder ``cradmin_instances`` we create a new file which will hold the public instances of messages. I have named
the file ``message_publicui_cradmin_instance.py``. To create a CRadmin instance which is public require no role nor any
login. This may not be correct since we also have implemented the CRadmin authentication, so if you try to look at any
page on localhost without being logged in, you will be promted to log in before gaining access to the page. However, we
will create a CRadmin instance which require neither log in nor a role. Beside this the CRadmin instance is just like
the once we have created.

.. literalinclude:: /../django_cradmin/demo/cradmin_gettingstarted/cradmin_instances/message_publicui_cradmin_instance.py


Crapps
------
In the ``crapps`` folder we create a new module named ``publicui``. Inside this module we add the file
``message_list_view.py``. To just make all messages in the system show up in a template, we can use the templates
provided by CRadmin. Here we need to implement the method `get_queryset_for_role`, and since this is a view inside the
public UI we can return all messages. ::

    class MessageListBuilderView(listbuilderview.View):
        """Builds the list for the view"""
        model = Message

        def get_queryset_for_role(self):
            return Message.objects.all()

In our ``__init__.py`` file for the publicui crapps, we add the url as we did earlier. ::

    from django_cradmin import crapp


    class App(crapp.App):
        appurls = [
            crapp.Url(
                r'^$',
                message_list_view.MessageListBuilderView.as_view(),
                name=crapp.INDEXVIEW_NAME)
        ]

Project urls
------------
The last thing we need is to add the CRadmin instance urls to our Django project urls. ::

    url(r'^gettingstarted/messages/', include(message_publicui_cradmin_instance.MessagePublicUiCradminInstance.urls())),

Localhost
---------
If you have added a message or two in Django admin, you will see them at `localhist/gettingstarted/messages`.

Expanding the listview for public messages
==========================================
In the last chapter we rendered a listview using pretty much just built in templates and functionality in CRadmin. Now
we are going to expand our view and create our own template with a bit more functionality than what basic CRadmin
offers. However, we are not going to create something totaly new. Almost everything we're going to use already lives
inside CRadmin.

Item Value Listbuilder
----------------------
We are going to a listbuilder class in the ``message_list_view_.py`` file and add functionality to our existing view
class. The listbuilder class ``MessageItemValue`` builds what we are going to see in our view and gives each item in the
list some values, while the class ``MessageListBuilderView`` is the view for showing what we have build. Since we need
to do some customization, we need to create a template for both classes.

We start the work by writing the listbuilder item value class. ::

    class MessageItemValue(listbuilder.itemvalue.TitleDescription):
        """Get values for items in the list"""

        valuealias = 'message'
        template_name = 'cradmin_gettingstarted/crapps/publicui/message_listbuilder.django.html'

        def get_description(self):
            return self.message.body

We want to get a hold of the message body and display it in the template. We use the super ``TitleDescription`` which is
one of several classes which render item values for a list. When overriding the method ``get_description`` we can return
the body of a message. As you can see we use the valuealias to get a hold of the message. In CRadmin the class
``AbstractRenderable`` sets `me` to be `self` in the context data. Therefore is the item value, wether being a list of
lists or a list of single objects, refered to as ``value``. This means we can write ``me.value`` in the template to show
the message. Further we can use `self.value` in the view class to work with a message. In our example where we just work
with one list object, it may not be nesseccary to use an alias for value. However, if we have several lists of
different objects, it would be hard to keep track of which object we are currently working with. So solve this problem
we set ``valuealias`` which overrides ``value``.

Item Value Template
-------------------
In the template we don't want the whole textfield of the message to show. If we use truncatechars in the
``block description-content`` without calling super, we can put new content in the existing p-tag. To get a hold of the
message body we just call ``me.get_description`` and add the length where we want to truncate the textfield. Now we
have overridden the content given by CRadmin as a default for the ``block description-content``, but we still use the
default CRadmin html-tags within the block.

When displaying the list of messages in the template we want to show the account which posted the message and the
timestamp. This can be done with the ``block below-description``. If you look in the html file which we extends, youÂ´ll
see that the block is empty by default, so we have to create the needed html-tags. In this example we put everything
inside a p-tag and add a span-tag for a CRadmin test css class used for testing the account name. An alternative is to
remove the span-tag and add a CRadmin test css class in the p-tag and test both account name and timestamp. ::

    {% extends 'django_cradmin/viewhelpers/listbuilder/itemvalue/titledescription.django.html' %}
    {% load cradmin_tags %}

    {% block description-content %}
        {{ me.get_description|truncatechars:"100" }}
    {% endblock description-content %}

    {% block below-description %}
        <p>
            Posted by: <span class="{% cradmin_test_css_class 'listbuilder-posted-by-account' %}">
            {{ me.message.account }}</span>
            at {{ me.message.creation_time }}
        </p>
    {% endblock below-description %}

Listbuilder View
----------------
The next step is to tell our listbuilder view to use our newly create value render class and to decide which template
we want for our view. ::

    class MessageListBuilderView(listbuilderview.View):
        """Builds the list for the view"""
        model = Message
        value_renderer_class = MessageItemValue
        template_name = 'cradmin_gettingstarted/crapps/publicui/message_list.django.html'

Listbuilder View Template
-------------------------
In this template we extend the defualt listbuilderview template in CRadmin and add some new content in the title and
page-cover-title block. Further we can hide the default content in the ``block messages`` by adding the block without
calling the super. The ``block message`` has nothing to do with the message objects we are working with. It is where
messages such as `Created new account` or `Deleted account` is shown. We will use this block to display a message to the
user if there are no messages in the system.

In the ``block content`` we use standard CSS classes which you find at `localhost/styleguide` on the html- tags. As you
can see we use some if logic where we check if ``listbuilder_list`` is empty or not. This variable name is provided by
CRadmin and is where all objects we render for our listview is stored by default. In our case the list is populated by
instances of the message object, if there are any in the database.

If there are messages we want to show them in a blocklist. Inside the blocklist we use the CRadmin tag
``cradmin_render_renderable`` and tell it to render the ``listbuilder_list``. In our view we will now get a blocklist
element for each message which shows both the body of the message and the content we chose to add below the description.
When there are no messages in our system we display an information message in the ``block message``. Here we also add
a CRadmin test css class so we can check that the if-test in our template works as intended.

in the system by creating a div with the class ``blocklist``. Within this
div-tag we use a CRadmin tag called ``cradmin_render_renderable`` and tell it to render ``listbuilder_list``. CRadmin
will now render the template we created for our listbuilder view with the item values we have decided. ::

    {% extends 'django cradmin/viewhelpers/listbuilderview/default.django.html' %}
    {% load cradmin_tags %}

    {% block title %}
        Gettingstarted
    {% endblock title  %}

    {% block page-cover-title %}
        Messages
    {% endblock page-cover-title %}

    {% block messages %}{% endblock messages %}

    {% block content %}
        <section class="adminui-page-section">
            <div class="container container--wide">
                {% if listbuilder_list %}
                    <div class="blocklist">
                        {% cradmin_render_renderable listbuilder_list %}
                    </div>
                {% else %}
                    <p class="text-center message message--info {% cradmin_test_css_class 'no-messages' %}">
                        No messages in system
                    </p>
                {% endif %}
            </div>
        </section>
    {% endblock content %}

Test Public Listview
--------------------
Now that we have created more functionality it is time to do some tests. As always there are several scenarios to test,
and we have to choose what to test. The point is to write a little code and than test it, or write the test first
and than the code. Either way, testing during development is important and should be done continuous for each bit of
code which does something. As you may have noticed we have not written any integration tests seeing if CRadmin is
working as intended with Django. This kind of testing is allready done in CRadmin, leaving unittesting to us.

So let's chose five things to test for our list view. First see if it displayes just one message and that the
description title is equal to the message's title. Second test involves several messages and checks that the body of a
each message is shown in the template. The third test is to check if the ``block message`` get our content when there
are no messages in the system. The fourth test for this section is for what we did in the template
``message_listbuilder.django.html`` and just checks if the account name which wrote the message is shown in template.
The fith and final test find the length of the message body in the template and checks if it is equal to what we said
in the template's ``block description-content``.

Since we use two templates in one test class, we add some comments making it easier to remember what we did when we
look at the code in the future and make it easier for other to understand what we have done.

So far we have used the hmtls selector ``one``. When displaying several messages in a template we need to use the htmls
selector ``list`` and count the number of times a CSS class occour, which should be equal to the number of messages
mommy makes. The tests is added in the file ``test_messages_list_view.py`` inside a new ``test_publicui`` module. ::

    from django.test import TestCase
    from model_mommy import mommy

    from django_cradmin import cradmin_testhelpers

As you probarly remember you can use ``mockresponse.selector.prettyprint()`` to print the template in your terminal and
find which tests css classes used in CRadmin if you have a mock request with htmls.

Make list item a link
---------------------
The plan is to later on make a detail view in the public UI so one can get more information about each message.
Therefore we need to make each list element a link. For the time being the link will just take us to the list view. To
make this happen we will use the Link class in ``listbuilder.itemframe` and use the methode ``get_url``. This method
will return ``cradmin_reverse_url`` where we set the id of the CRadmin instance and the app name. In our case the id is
`cr_public_message` and the appname is `public_message`, as written in the CRadmin instance file for the public UI. ::

    class MessageItemFrameLink(listbuilder.itemframe.Link):
        """Make each frame around the list itmes a link"""

        def get_url(self):
            return reverse_cradmin_url(instanceid='cr_public_message', appname='public_message')

In our listbuilder view we set the ``frame_renderer_class`` to be our newly created Link class. ::

    class MessageListBuilderView(listbuilderview.View):
        """Builds the list for the view"""

        model = Message
        value_renderer_class = MessageItemValue
        frame_renderer_class = MessageItemFrameLink

Test item frame and link
------------------------
Since we will change the link url later on, all we tests for now is if it renders. Lets write the test in our
``test_message_list_view.py`` file. ::

        def test_item_frame_and_link_from_listbuilder(self):
            mommy.make('cradmin_gettingstarted.Message')
            mockresponse = self.mock_http200_getrequest_htmls()
            render_item_frame = mockresponse.selector.one('.test-cradmin-listbuilder-item-frame-renderer')
            listbuilder_link = mockresponse.selector.one('.test-cradmin-listbuilder-link')
            self.assertTrue(render_item_frame)
            self.assertTrue(listbuilder_link)

Do you remember to take a break from the screen and stretch your body?

Public Message Detail View
==========================
Now it is time to create a detail view which is shown when a user clicks any message in our listview of messages. Inside
the detailview one should be able to see the whole message and number of likes. To make the detail view work we need
to update the class ``MessageItemFrameLink``, add an url to the detail view in the ``__init__.py`` file, create a new
detail view and decide which template to use.

Item Frame Link
---------------
As you remember we have already created an item frame link around each message in our list view. We now need to tell
that this link should point to the detail view. We can use a ``valuealias`` to set the pk in kwargs in our url. Further
we set the CRadmin instance id, application name and view name. Our ``MessageItemFrameLink`` class now looks something
like this ::

    class MessageItemFrameLink(listbuilder.itemframe.Link):
        """Make each frame around the list itmes a link"""
        valuealias = 'message'

        def get_url(self):
            return reverse_cradmin_url(
                instanceid='cr_public_message',
                appname='public_message',
                viewname='detail',
                kwargs={
                    'pk': self.message.id
                }
            )

Url in init file
----------------
In the ``__init__.pt`` file within our CRadmin application ``publicui`` we add the url with an pk and set the viewname
equal to what we used for the ``get_url`` method. ::

    class App(crapp.App):
    appurls = [
        crapp.Url(
            r'^$',
            message_list_view.MessageListBuilderView.as_view(),
            name=crapp.INDEXVIEW_NAME),
        crapp.Url(
            r'^detail/(?P<pk>\d+)$',
            message_detail_view.MessageDetailView.as_view(),
            name='detail')
    ]

Message Detail View
-------------------
Next we create a file named ``message_detail_view`` in our CRadmin application ``publicui``. Here we create a a class
which inherit from CRadmins ``DetailView``. There is also an ``DetailRoleView`` class you can use as super if there is
a role in question, for instance if we create a detail view for messages in our ``account_admin`` crapps. Nevertheless,
we use the ``DetailView`` as a super, so our detail view class looks like this ::

    from django_cradmin import viewhelpers
    from django_cradmin.demo.cradmin_gettingstarted.models import Message


    class MessageDetailView(viewhelpers.detail.DetailView):
        """"""
        template_name = 'cradmin_gettingstarted/crapps/publicui/message_detail.django.html'

        def get_queryset_for_role(self):
            """"""
            return Message.objects.all()

        def get_context_data(self, **kwargs):
            context = super(MessageDetailView, self).get_context_data(**kwargs)
            context['message'] = self.get_object()
            print(context)
            return context

Detail Template
---------------
In our template folder we create a html file named ``message_detail.django.html`` which extends
``django_cradmin/base.django.html``. In the template we add blocks for title, page cover title and content. Inside the
content block we add which details we want to show for a message. There is not much more info here than in the list
view, than again the user now can see the whole message and number of likes beside the timestamp and account name which
wrote the message. Further we add some CRadmin test css classes for our tests. The detail view template looks like this.
::

    {% extends 'django_cradmin/base.django.html' %}
    {% load cradmin_tags %}

    {% block title  %}
        Message details
    {% endblock title %}

    {% block page-cover-title %}
        Message Details
    {% endblock page-cover-title %}

    {% block content %}
        <section class="adminui-page-section">
            <div class="container container--tight">
                <h2>{{ message }}</h2>
                <p>{{ message.body }}</p>
                <p class="paragraph paragraph--xtight {% cradmin_test_css_class 'public-detail-posted-by' %}">
                    Posted by: {{ message.account }}
                </p>
                <p class="paragraph paragraph--xtight"> Time: {{ message.creation_time }}</p>
                <p class="paragraph paragraph--xtight {% cradmin_test_css_class 'public-detail-likes' %}">
                    Likes: {{ message.number_of_likes }}
                </p>
            </div>
        </section>
    {% endblock content %}

In the p-tags which shows the message owne, time of creation and number of likes we use the classes ``paragraph`` and
``paragraph--xtight`` to decrease white space between the the paragraphs coming after the message's body.

Test Detail View
----------------
We test that the detail view shows the message information as intended, and that our item frame link has the
correct href. This means we need to rewrite the item link test method in the file ``test_message_list_view.py`` file
and create a new file within the same folder and name it ``test_message_detail_view.py``.

Lest start with rewriting the test for item frame link. In this test we fetch the href after a get request and compare
the result to what we should get looking at our new constructed url. From the project urls we should get
``/gettingstarted``. From the CRadmin application we're working with, we should get ``/messages``. From our view we
should get the view name and id of the message ``/detail/<id_as_integer>``. When we use a real url, we may ran into
trouble down the line when there is changes in our project. So solve this problem we could use MagicMock to mock both
the CRadmin application and to add something to the expected url. However, we are not going to introduce MagicMock in
this tutorial. So we will stick to our real url.

After rewriting both method name and content, the test now looks like this.
::

    def test_listbuilder_link_href_sanity(self):
        """Test for template ``message_listbuilder_view.django.html"""
        message = mommy.make('cradmin_gettingstarted.Message')
        mockresponse = self.mock_http200_getrequest_htmls(
            viewkwargs={'pk': message.id}
        )
        listbuilder_link = mockresponse.selector.one('.test-cradmin-listbuilder-link')
        self.assertTrue(listbuilder_link)
        href_in_template = mockresponse.selector.one('.test-cradmin-listbuilder-item-frame-renderer')['href']
        expected_href = '/gettingstarted/messages/detail/{}'.format(message.id)
        self.assertEqual(expected_href, href_in_template)

In our new test file ``test_message_deatil_view.py`` which is inside the test module ``test_publicui``, we create a new
test class and add the methods of what we want to test. As usually you may want to test something different than what
we test in this guide. The point is to write some code and test it. When we test the more simple parts of our code,
there is easier to get the more complicated parts to run without errors. We know the structure behind works up to some
point.

This time we test the primary title in the template, who posted the message and if the number of likes can both be a
psotive number and a negative number.

Easy Change the Urls for CRadmin Instances
==========================================
In you CRadmin instance for public UI we have the following name for our application ::

    apps = [
        ('public_message', publicui.App),
    ]

If we don't add another apps to the list, the url in the browser will be extended with the viewname (`detail` in this
case) and the pk of the message. The url looks like this in the browser
``http://localhost/gettingstarted/messages/detail/1``. However, if you have a project where you want to have more
specified broweser urls. Let us say we want an url which says ``messages/public/detail/1``. All we need to do is to add
a new name and point it to the correct init file for the view in the ``apps`` list in CRadmin instance. ::

    apps = [
        ('public_message', publicui.App),
        ('public', publicui.App)
    ]

We update our ``get_url`` method in the ``MessageItemFrameLink`` class so it uses the new application name ::

    def get_url(self):
        return reverse_cradmin_url(
            instanceid='cr_public_message',
            appname='public',
            viewname='detail',
            kwargs={
                'pk': self.message.id
            }
        )

When we now go to the detial view for a message, the url in the browser reads
``http://localhost/gettingstarted/messages/public/detail/1``. Now, we are going to stick with the url
``http://localhost/gettingstarted/messages/detail/1`` in our further work.

Add CRadmin menu
================
Back to list of messages. Messages created by the user which created the message in the detail view.

Admin UI for Messages
=====================
In this chapter we are going to add functionality needed to create a message without going to the Django admin. There
are several ways we can approach this, for instance we can create one or several views for messages within our exisiting
account admin UI CRadmin application, rename the public UI application to message UI application with both public and
admin views inside or we can create a new new CRadmin application with it's own CRadmin instance. Offcourse are there
pros and cons to all solutions. Further there is solutions not mentioned here. However, since a message has a foreign
key to an account, there is a logical point allowing the CRadmin instance of the account admin Cradmin application being
in charge of handling message creation, editing and deletion.


Create our own CSS class for public message list view
=====================================================
This should be in a later part
